## Terms and Conditions

In these Terms and Conditions, "we," "us," and "our" refer to Thorg LLC. "You" and "your" refer to any person or entity exercising rights under this license.

### The Software

The "Software" is each version of the software that we make available under
these Terms and Conditions, as indicated by our inclusion of these Terms and
Conditions with the Software.

### License Grant

Subject to your compliance with this License Grant and the Limitations,
Patents, Redistribution, and Trademark clauses below, we hereby grant you the
right to use, copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly perform, publicly
display, and redistribute the Software for any Permitted Purpose identified
below.

This license grant does not include access to functionality protected by a
license key or subscription validation. Access to protected functionality
requires a separate paid subscription from us.

### Permitted Purpose

A Permitted Purpose is any purpose other than a Competing Use. A Competing Use
means making the Software available to others in a commercial product or
service that:

1. substitutes for the Software;

2. substitutes for any other product or service we offer using the Software
   that exists as of the date we make the Software available;

3. offers the same or substantially similar functionality as the Software; or

4. makes the functionality of the Software available to third parties over a
   network, including but not limited to offering the Software as a hosted
   service, software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), or
   any similar remote access arrangement, where such service substitutes for
   or competes with the Software or any product or service we offer.

### Limitations

You must not move, change, disable, or circumvent the license key functionality
or subscription validation mechanisms in the Software.

You may modify portions of the Software protected by a license key or
subscription validation, provided that such modifications do not:

1. enable access to protected functionality without authorization;

2. remove the protected functionality; or

3. bypass, disable, or circumvent the subscription validation mechanisms.

### Patents

To the extent your use for a Permitted Purpose would necessarily infringe our
patents, the license grant above includes a license under our patents. If you
make a claim against any party that the Software infringes or contributes to
the infringement of any patent, then your patent license to the Software ends
immediately.

### Redistribution

The Terms and Conditions apply to all copies, modifications, and derivatives of
the Software.

If you redistribute any copies, modifications, or derivatives of the Software,
you must include a copy of or a link to these Terms and Conditions and not
remove any copyright or other proprietary notices provided in or with the
Software.

### Feedback and Contributions

If you provide us with any feedback, suggestions, comments, or code contributions (including but not limited to pull requests, patches, or modifications submitted to us) regarding the Software (collectively, "Contributions"), you hereby grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, copy, modify, distribute, incorporate into the Software, and otherwise exploit such Contributions for any purpose without restriction or compensation to you. You represent that you have the right to grant this license for any Contributions you submit.

### Termination

If you violate any of these Terms, your rights under this license terminate
automatically. Upon termination, you must cease all use and destroy all copies,
modifications, and derivatives of the Software in your possession.

### Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT WILL WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
SOFTWARE, INCLUDING INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY IN ADVANCE.

OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY
PAID BY YOU TO US FOR THE SOFTWARE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING
THE CLAIM, OR $50.00 USD, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

In the event the provision of this Disclaimer section is unenforceable under
applicable law, the licenses granted herein are void.

### Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, that provision
shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and
the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

### Governing Law

These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Mexico, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the State of New Mexico, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein.

### Trademarks

Except for identifying us as the origin of the Software, you have no right
under these Terms and Conditions to use our trademarks, trade names, service
marks, or product names.
